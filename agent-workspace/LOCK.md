# Agent Lock

## Active lock
Status: locked
Agent: ChatGPT
Branch: agent/chatgpt/HV-001-agent-operating-layer
Task: HV-001
Files/areas reserved:
- agent-workspace/**
- .github/**
Started: 2026-04-24
Expires: 2026-04-25

## Rules
- Only one agent may hold a lock for the same task area.
- The lock must list files or directories being touched.
- A stale lock may be overridden only after documenting why in `HANDOFF_LOG.md`.
- If another active lock touches the same files or task area, do not edit those files.
- The agent that completes the task must change status to `unlocked` before final handoff, unless a PR is still actively open.
