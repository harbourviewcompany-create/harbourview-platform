# Harbourview Evidence Log

Last updated: 2026-05-29
Status: Finish-line reset scaffold with MP-SCHEMA-001 follow-up verification HOLD recorded
Authority: Canonical evidence log for Harbourview finish-line execution

## Purpose

This document records evidence for Harbourview build, deployment, security/leakage, admin/auth/RLS, marketplace, and finish-line completion claims.

A claim is not final unless evidence is linked or recorded here.

## Evidence Rule

Use this file to prove current-state and completion claims. Do not treat old evidence as current unless it is revalidated or explicitly promoted during the finish-line reset.

Evidence must state:

- Date
- Scope
- Source or command
- Result
- Link or artifact reference when available
- Whether the evidence is current, legacy, blocked, or superseded

## Current Evidence Status

Pass 1 created/updated control documentation only. It did not run build, test, deployment, route, admin/auth, RLS, marketplace, or production probes.

| Area | Current evidence status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Repo control docs | In progress | Pass 1 creates/updates the five control docs |
| Build/typecheck/lint | Unknown | MP-SCHEMA-001 follow-up PR requests clean verification; exact command outputs are pending |
| Deployment | Unknown | Not verified in Pass 1; PR #530 Cloudflare preview succeeded, but canonical Vercel production proof remains separate |
| Public route checks | Unknown | Not run in Pass 1 |
| Public/private leakage checks | Partial static coverage | MP-SCHEMA-001 DTO tests exist; runtime `test:visibility` output remains pending |
| Admin/auth/RLS checks | Unknown | Not run in Pass 1 |
| Marketplace flows | Unknown | Not run in Pass 1 |
| Production writes | Not authorized | Must remain gated and explicit |

## Build Evidence

| Date | Check | Command / source | Result | Link / artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-28 | Pass 1 control-doc creation | GitHub contents API via connected GitHub tool | Created/updated docs only | Commit SHAs to be listed in final Pass 1 report | Current |
| 2026-05-29 | MP-SCHEMA-001 follow-up verification PR opened | `docs/mp-schema-001-verification-evidence` / `docs/control/MP_SCHEMA_001_VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md` | Verification requested; exact runner outputs pending | Follow-up PR to be linked after creation | Current HOLD |

## MP-SCHEMA-001 Verification Follow-up

**Evidence ID:** `HV-MP-SCHEMA-001-VERIFY-20260529`

**Source change:** PR `#530`, MP-SCHEMA-001 unified marketplace listings schema, DTO validation, and tests.

**Follow-up branch:** `docs/mp-schema-001-verification-evidence`

**Follow-up scope:** docs/control evidence and registry discipline only. No runtime code, schema, migrations, DTO implementation, tests, dependencies, auth, RLS, deployment settings, Supabase settings, or production write behavior are intentionally changed by this follow-up.

**Required commands:**

- `npm ci`
- `npm run check:migrations`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npx vitest run tests/harbourview/unified-listings-dto.test.ts`
- `npm run test:visibility`
- `npm run build`
- Supabase migration dry-run/review when available

**Current result:** HOLD pending clean runner output and Supabase migration dry-run/review evidence.

**Known prior findings:**

- Project Registry Discipline failure for PR `#530` was caused by missing registry-impact PR metadata, not by a confirmed schema/runtime defect.
- Low-Friction Branch Verification failure for PR `#530` was expected because the original schema PR changed `lib/`, `supabase/`, and `tests/`, outside the control-only profile.
- Branch Verification failed for PR `#530`, but exact job logs were unavailable through the connected GitHub tool, so no concrete failing command/error line was available to patch.
- PR `#530` Cloudflare Pages preview reported deploy success for commit `7ca4b75`; Vercel/Netlify preview issues were not accepted as schema/runtime proof.

**GO criteria:** Exact outputs must prove all required commands pass, runtime leakage verification passes, and Supabase migration dry-run/review is non-blocking.

## Deployment Evidence

| Date | Environment | URL | Result | Link / artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | Not verified in Pass 1 | TBD | Unknown |

## Security / Leakage Evidence

| Date | Check | Scope | Result | Link / artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-29 | MP-SCHEMA-001 DTO boundary static/test coverage | Unified listing DTO allowlist and forbidden-key test file from PR #530 | Partial coverage present; runtime public-route leakage still pending | `tests/harbourview/unified-listings-dto.test.ts`; `npm run test:visibility` pending | Current HOLD |
| TBD | Runtime public leakage verification | Public routes / built app | Not verified in Pass 1 or this evidence-only update | TBD | Unknown |

## Admin / Auth / RLS Evidence

| Date | Check | Result | Link / artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TBD | TBD | Not verified in Pass 1 | TBD | Unknown |

## Marketplace Flow Evidence

| Date | Flow | Result | Link / artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| TBD | TBD | Not verified in Pass 1 | TBD | Unknown |

## Known Unproven Claims

| Claim | Why unproven | Required evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current production deployment state | Pass 1 did not inspect deployment runtime | Deployment URL, status, route checks, relevant probe results | Open |
| Current feature readiness | Pass 1 did not inspect app runtime or tests | Build/test/probe evidence from current repo/deployment | Open |
| Current admin/auth/RLS readiness | Pass 1 did not run role/access checks | Current role matrix/access verification | Open |
| Current public/private leakage posture | Pass 1 did not run leakage probes | Current static/runtime leakage checks | Open |
| MP-SCHEMA-001 release readiness | Required post-merge verification commands and Supabase dry-run/review are not yet recorded | Clean outputs for npm/migration/typecheck/lint/Vitest/visibility/build plus Supabase review | Open |

## Preserved Legacy Evidence Entries

The entries below existed before the finish-line source-of-truth reset. They are preserved for traceability, but they are not automatically current. Treat them as legacy evidence until revalidated or promoted into current evidence.

## 2026-05-09: Production deployment trigger after listings route restore

**Evidence ID:** `HV-PRODUCTION-LISTINGS-ROUTE-DEPLOY-20260509`

**Branch:** `main`

**Base commit:** `51a9aed7bbfde3316b6019582dba551ce0590d78`

**Purpose:** Documentation-only production deployment trigger after the safe `/marketplace/listings` route restoration and public IA cleanup were present on `main` but not yet reflected on `https://harbourview.vercel.app`.

**Expected production checks:** `/`, `/marketplace`, `/marketplace/listings`, `/marketplace/wanted`, `/marketplace/sell`, `/intake`, `/signals`, `/compliance`, `/about`, `/contact`, and `/admin`.

**Required assertions:** public routes return expected 200s, anonymous `/admin` denies access, `/marketplace/listings` is not 404, `/marketplace/sell` does not expose `Supplier Directory Listing`, `Supplier Directory` public exposure is zero, and forbidden public leakage strings are zero.

## 2026-05-09: Main verification trigger request

**Evidence ID:** `HV-MAIN-VERIFICATION-TRIGGER-20260509`

**Branch:** `verify/main-gates-20260509`

**Base commit:** `df5345630a0f01dd3de6ae4112ebd421bd2a7ce5`

**Purpose:** Documentation-only no-op PR to trigger Branch Verification and Regulatory Signals Verify after the post-PR #175/#191 verification-gate repairs.

**Expected checks:** `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:services-public-leakage`, and `npm run test:regulatory-signals-public-leakage`.

**Merge policy:** Do not merge this trigger PR unless both workflows pass.

## 2026-05-14: Verification/control-plane readiness pass (Agent 3 lane)

**Evidence ID:** `HV-VERIFY-CONTROL-PLANE-20260514`

**Branch:** `codex/harbourview-verification-control-plane`

**Scope:** CI/tests/probes/docs/control (no UI implementation changes, no backend/auth behavioral changes).

**Commands and results (UTC):**
- `npm run typecheck` — PASS
- `npm run lint` — PASS (warnings only)
- `npm run test:intelligence-os` — PASS (8/8 tests)
- `npm run verify:leakage` — PASS (static forbidden-token leakage gate)
- `npm run verify:admin-auth` — PASS (anonymous/missing/viewer/analyst denied; operator/admin allowed)
- `npm run verify:marketplace-smoke` — PASS (route/workflow guards + production write fail-closed controls)
- `npm run build` — PASS

**Blocked/not run:**
- Production write smoke execution: NOT RUN/GATED by required env gates and credentials.
- Runtime public leakage HTML probe: BLOCKED unless `HARBOURVIEW_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is provided.

**Operational conclusion:**
- Local/CI-safe verification gates are materially stronger and explicit.
- Production readiness remains HOLD until production/env-backed probes are executed with controlled credentials and evidence artifacts.
