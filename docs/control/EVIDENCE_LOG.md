# Harbourview Evidence Log

Last updated: 2026-06-26
Status: Gate 4 GO; MP-SCHEMA-001 verification commands PASS (2026-06-26)
Authority: Canonical evidence log for Harbourview finish-line execution

## Purpose

This document records evidence for Harbourview build, deployment, security/leakage, admin/auth/RLS, marketplace, and finish-line completion claims.

A claim is not final unless evidence is linked or recorded here.

## Evidence Rule

Use this file to prove current-state and completion claims. Do not treat old evidence as current unless it is revalidated or explicitly promoted during the finish-line reset.

Evidence must state:

- Date
- Scope
- Source or command
- Result
- Link or artifact reference when available
- Whether the evidence is current, legacy, blocked, or superseded

## Current Evidence Status

Pass 1 created/updated control documentation only. It did not run build, test, deployment, route, admin/auth, RLS, marketplace, or production probes.

| Area | Current evidence status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Repo control docs | In progress | Pass 1 creates/updates the five control docs |
| Build/typecheck/lint | Unknown | MP-SCHEMA-001 follow-up PR requests clean verification; exact command outputs are pending |
| Deployment | Unknown | Not verified in Pass 1; PR #530 Cloudflare preview succeeded, but canonical Vercel production proof remains separate |
| Public route checks | Unknown | Not run in Pass 1 |
| Public/private leakage checks | Partial static coverage | MP-SCHEMA-001 DTO tests exist; runtime `test:visibility` output remains pending |
| Admin/auth/RLS checks | Unknown | Not run in Pass 1 |
| Marketplace flows | Unknown | Not run in Pass 1 |
| Production writes | Not authorized | Must remain gated and explicit |

## Build Evidence

| Date | Check | Command / source | Result | Link / artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-28 | Pass 1 control-doc creation | GitHub contents API via connected GitHub tool | Created/updated docs only | Commit SHAs to be listed in final Pass 1 report | Legacy |
| 2026-06-11 | MP-SCHEMA-001 follow-up verification PR opened | `docs/mp-schema-001-verify-20260611` / `docs/control/MP_SCHEMA_001_VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md` | Verification requested; exact runner outputs pending | Follow-up PR to be linked after creation | Legacy HOLD |
| 2026-06-25 | Gate 4 full test-suite baseline | All `test:*` scripts + `typecheck` + `lint` + `build` on branch `claude/gate-4-verification-baseline` | 19 test scripts PASS (267 total assertions); `typecheck` 0 errors; `lint` 0 errors; `build` clean; tooling gap closed in PR #857 — see Gate 4 detail | Branch `claude/gate-4-verification-baseline`; PR #857 | **Current — Gate 4 GO** |

### Gate 4 Detailed Evidence — 2026-06-25

**Evidence ID:** `HV-GATE4-BASELINE-20260625`

**Branch:** `claude/gate-4-verification-baseline`

**Base:** `main` as of 2026-06-25

**Scope:** Static verification baseline — typecheck, lint, build, and all named `test:*` scripts.

**Results:**

| Command | Result | Assertion count |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | PASS | 0 errors |
| `npm run lint` | PASS | 0 errors; 5 `no-unused-vars` warnings in non-production code |
| `npm run build` | PASS | clean |
| `npm run test:visibility` | PASS | 24 |
| `npm run test:admin-guard` | PASS | 16 |
| `npm run test:public-images` | PASS | 12 |
| `npm run test:listing-quality` | PASS | 12 |
| `npm run test:intelligence-fixtures` | PASS | 16 |
| `npm run test:intelligence-os` | PASS | 16 |
| `npm run test:regulatory-signals-public-leakage` | PASS | 2 |
| `npm run test:regulatory-signals-contract` | PASS | 8 |
| `npm run test:services-public-leakage` | PASS | 2 |
| `npm run test:used-surplus-public-leakage` | PASS | 2 |
| `npm run test:globe-router` | PASS | 78 |
| `npm run test:country-role` | PASS | 14 |
| `npm run test:compliance-visibility` | PASS | 16 |
| `npm run test:signal-engine-runtime` | PASS | 22 |
| `npm run test:genetics-profile-redaction` | PASS | 9 |
| `npm run test:genetics-routing` | PASS | 18 |

**Total assertions (all scripts):** 267 passed, 0 failed.

**Tooling gap:** CLOSED — `test:genetics-profile-redaction` (9 assertions) and `test:genetics-routing` (18 assertions) added to `package.json` in PR #857 (merged 2026-06-25). `vitest.config.ts` updated to exclude `.claude/**` worktree copies. All 19 Gate 4 commands now pass.

**GO decision:** Gate 4 → **GO**. All 19 commands pass cleanly. Tooling gap fully closed.

## MP-SCHEMA-001 Verification Follow-up

**Evidence ID:** `HV-MP-SCHEMA-001-VERIFY-20260611`

**Source change:** PR `#530`, MP-SCHEMA-001 unified marketplace listings schema, DTO validation, and tests.

**Follow-up branch:** `docs/mp-schema-001-verify-20260611`

**Follow-up scope:** docs/control evidence and registry discipline only. No runtime code, schema, migrations, DTO implementation, tests, dependencies, auth, RLS, deployment settings, Supabase settings, or production write behavior are intentionally changed by this follow-up.

**Required commands:**

- `npm ci`
- `npm run check:migrations`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npx vitest run tests/harbourview/unified-listings-dto.test.ts`
- `npm run test:visibility`
- `npm run build`
- Supabase migration dry-run/review when available

**Current result:** PASS — all runnable commands verified 2026-06-26 on branch `main` (post-PR-#860 merge, commit `c881babe`).

| Command | Date | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | 2026-06-26 | PASS — 0 errors |
| `npm run lint` | 2026-06-26 | PASS — 0 errors; 5 no-unused-vars warnings in non-production code |
| `npx vitest run tests/harbourview/unified-listings-dto.test.ts` | 2026-06-26 | PASS — 5/5 tests |
| `npm run test:visibility` | 2026-06-26 | PASS — 12/12 tests (3 files) |
| `npm run build` | 2026-06-26 | PASS — clean |
| `npm run check:migrations` | 2026-06-26 | SKIP — script not present in package.json; no migration tooling gap identified |
| Supabase migration dry-run/review | — | DEFERRED — requires Supabase MCP operator session; no blocking migration defect found in prior review |

**Known prior findings:**

- Project Registry Discipline failure for PR `#530` was caused by missing registry-impact PR metadata, not by a confirmed schema/runtime defect.
- Low-Friction Branch Verification failure for PR `#530` was expected because the original schema PR changed `lib/`, `supabase/`, and `tests/`, outside the control-only profile.
- Branch Verification failed for PR `#530`, but exact job logs were unavailable through the connected GitHub tool, so no concrete failing command/error line was available to patch.
- PR `#530` Cloudflare Pages preview reported deploy success for commit `7ca4b75`; Vercel/Netlify preview issues were not accepted as schema/runtime proof.

**Decision:** MP-SCHEMA-001 static/test verification PASS. Supabase dry-run deferred — non-blocking. Gate 11 advances to **PASS (partial)** pending operator Supabase review.

## Preserved Legacy Evidence Entries

The entries below existed before the finish-line source-of-truth reset. They are preserved for traceability, but they are not automatically current. Treat them as legacy evidence until revalidated or promoted into current evidence.

## 2026-05-09: Production deployment trigger after listings route restore

**Evidence ID:** `HV-PRODUCTION-LISTINGS-ROUTE-DEPLOY-20260509`

**Branch:** `main`

**Base commit:** `51a9aed7bbfde3316b6019582dba551ce0590d78`

**Purpose:** Documentation-only production deployment trigger after the safe `/marketplace/listings` route restoration and public IA cleanup were present on `main` but not yet reflected on `https://harbourview.vercel.app`.

**Expected production checks:** `/`, `/marketplace`, `/marketplace/listings`, `/marketplace/wanted`, `/marketplace/sell`, `/intake`, `/signals`, `/compliance`, `/about`, `/contact`, and `/admin`.

**Required assertions:** public routes return expected 200s, anonymous `/admin` denies access, `/marketplace/listings` is not 404, `/marketplace/sell` does not expose `Supplier Directory Listing`, `Supplier Directory` public exposure is zero, and forbidden public leakage strings are zero.

## 2026-05-09: Main verification trigger request

**Evidence ID:** `HV-MAIN-VERIFICATION-TRIGGER-20260509`

**Branch:** `verify/main-gates-20260509`

**Base commit:** `df5345630a0f01dd3de6ae4112ebd421bd2a7ce5`

**Purpose:** Documentation-only no-op PR to trigger Branch Verification and Regulatory Signals Verify after the post-PR #175/#191 verification-gate repairs.

**Expected checks:** `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:services-public-leakage`, and `npm run test:regulatory-signals-public-leakage`.

**Merge policy:** Do not merge this trigger PR unless both workflows pass.

## 2026-05-14: Verification/control-plane readiness pass (Agent 3 lane)

**Evidence ID:** `HV-VERIFY-CONTROL-PLANE-20260514`

**Branch:** `codex/harbourview-verification-control-plane`

**Scope:** CI/tests/probes/docs/control (no UI implementation changes, no backend/auth behavioral changes).

**Commands and results (UTC):**
- `npm run typecheck` — PASS
- `npm run lint` — PASS (warnings only)
- `npm run test:intelligence-os` — PASS (8/8 tests)
- `npm run verify:leakage` — PASS (static forbidden-token leakage gate)
- `npm run verify:admin-auth` — PASS (anonymous/missing/viewer/analyst denied; operator/admin allowed)
- `npm run verify:marketplace-smoke` — PASS (route/workflow guards + production write fail-closed controls)
- `npm run build` — PASS

**Blocked/not run:**
- Production write smoke execution: NOT RUN/GATED by required env gates and credentials.
- Runtime public leakage HTML probe: BLOCKED unless `HARBOURVIEW_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is provided.

**Operational conclusion:**
- Local/CI-safe verification gates are materially stronger and explicit.
- Production readiness remains HOLD until production/env-backed probes are executed with controlled credentials and evidence artifacts.
